Error in rule list_creator:

    output: results/lists/list_organisms_merged.csv, results/lists/list_PGC_infos.csv
    shell:

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job list_creator since they might be corrupted:
results/lists/list_PGC_infos.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
