MissingOutputException in rule tree_creator in file /home/salzatht/Documents/Projet_test/5eme_test/Snakefile, line 127:
Job 310  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/tree/PGC_bchY/PGC_bchY
Removing output files of failed job tree_creator since they might be corrupted:
results/tree/PGC_bchY/PGC_bchY.treefile, results/tree/PGC_bchY/PGC_bchY.log, results/tree/PGC_bchY/PGC_bchY.model.gz, results/tree/PGC_bchY/PGC_bchY.bionj, results/tree/PGC_bchY/PGC_bchY.mldist, results/tree/PGC_bchY/PGC_bchY.ckp.gz, results/tree/PGC_bchY/PGC_bchY.iqtree
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
