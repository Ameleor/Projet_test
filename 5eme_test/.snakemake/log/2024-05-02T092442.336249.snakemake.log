MissingOutputException in rule fasta_creator in file /home/salzatht/Documents/Projet_test/5eme_test/Snakefile, line 77:
Job 123  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/fasta/GCF_001576595.1_ASM157659v1/PGC_crtF.faa
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
